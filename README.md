# oscommerce_deutsch

This project began as a fork from a package which was bundled on the oscommerce-deutsch.de website and added some small (mostly cosmetic) fixes to the package to optimise the software for a German speaking audience.

I know that osCommerce is a fairly old package but I personally found it nice to specialize in one particular shop system and learn about the internals of a Free Software eCommerce solution.

The package also includes some patches to have osCommerce running with PHP7 MySQL support as there have been some changes.

In that respect I would like to thank all the people who helped me out on https://forums.oscommerce.de/

Happy selling and happy hacking!
